# Telcom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ANN
Build a Artificial Neural Network with an Precision and Accuracy of 85% &amp; 80%. 

## About Dataset - The data set includes information about:

1. Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

2. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

3. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

4. Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

### In this Repository I use Python Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn to analyze, visualize and predict customer churn

I start by cleaning and exploring our data. Tasks during this section include:

 1. Explore data 
 
 2. check Null values
 
 3. check the distribution of data
 
 4. drop unuseful columns
 
 5. correct DataType of columns
 
 6. Data visualization

# Once I have explored, visualized and cleaned the data, I move to the model building section. Tasks during this section include:
  
 1. Converting categorical data into numerical data.
 
 2. Apply Min-Max Scaler to Scale the values
 
 3. Build a Ann(artificial neural network) model.
 
 4. use Classification report for model evaluation.
